  subtitle: "Introduction"
  subcontent: "Healthcare Text, also called as Healthcare Data can be considered as a rich source of information for conducting researches on chronic conditions and illness. With the vast use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, it has helped improve the quality of patient care. Using AI to perform analysis over sensitive health data has proven to be very useful especially in this era of lifestyle. Here we use a tool to extract the data from an individual gene report and store it in the system's database for analysis. The technology called the Optical Character Recognization is used in the tool to extract the data from scanned documents or tables."
