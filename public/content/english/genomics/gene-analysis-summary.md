  content : "Genetic analysis refers to the overall process of studying and researching in scientific fields involving genetics and molecular biology."
  subtitle: "Introduction"
  subcontent: "Gene Analysis is the identification, measurement, or comparison of genomic features such as DNA sequence, structural variation, gene expression, or regulatory and functional element annotation at the genomic scale. Analysing one's gene data leads us to the path of finding changes in each strand of the DNA and recording them. Our tool compares the individual gene data summary report against the findings to provide more clear insights about chronics conditions."
