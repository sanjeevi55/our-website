  content : "A one-place platform which provides easy access to all of the recommended supplements by their Practitioner and also an option to buy the supplements from the same platform."
  subtitle: "Introduction"
  subcontent: "According to Nutrigenomics, gene interaction with nutrition is considered the first step of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of various health conditions. The use of the latest technologies like artificial intelligence has completely altered the approach to nutrition and exercise. A supplement is an additional nutrient taken externally for the build of proteins within the human body. In recent days, there are many supplements manufactured by various Pharmaceutical companies, which greatly confuses the healthcare providers as well as the care inheritors. They do not know which supplement will be good & suitable for their health. We Health Engineers give you a platform that allows only high-quality & approved Supplements from the database for the Practitioners to recommend to their patients. They can suggest combinations of the supplements from the database that can be sold to the patient via the platform or the patient can buy them from outside, if not from their practitioner."
