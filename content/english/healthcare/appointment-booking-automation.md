  content : "Automated patient scheduling aids in the management of the time between the patient & the nurse when an appointment is made and when the patient arrives for their visit."
  subtitle: "Introduction"
  subcontent: "Automated scheduling solutions do not necessitate the involvement of a medical staff, which automatically improves patient access. If a cancellation occurs, the system will look at patients who have appointments scheduled in the future and determine who is most qualified for the time allotted. Working with an automated system that does not require human intervention will save your practice time and money."
